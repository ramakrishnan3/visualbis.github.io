Storage and Collaboration
=========================

You can use this enhancement on the product to upload, save & store, audit, comment, and collaborate on your model. You can also export and/or run further analysis on the baseline, comparison, and the simulated data series available across the entire model.

1. Uploading the ValQ Model
----------------------------

After logging in to the relevant workspace, you can see the 'Upload' button and your profile icon at the bezel.

In the screenshot model, lets assume you delete a node 'Ryan Smith'

Lets also assume you simulate on the node 'Chris Morris'

You can save these changes at the workspace by clicking 'Upload' near your profile icon, naming your model, and clicking 'upload' at the popup window.

Once your model is uploaded, you can see additional icons at the bezel such as Save, Comments, and additional options having Exporting, History log, & Settings.

2. Commenting
--------------

You can comment on the changes you have made by clicking the 'Comment' icon on top of the node. After posting, your comment is saved alongside your username and time log.

Alternatively, you can check the comment log for the entire model by clicking 'Comments' icon at the bezel.
Comments are displayed at a Scenario-Node level.

3. History Log
---------------

As you go to additional options and click 'History Log', you can see the model and scenario level changes made in a chronological order.
This feature helps with auditing the ValQ model.

4. Collaboration
-----------------

After saving, you can collaborate on your model changes with other users under the same workspace.
Assuming a 'Member' from the workspace simulates on the existing scenario, creates a new scenario, deletes another node, comments on the changes made, and saves the model.

Once you log back in, all the changes in the ValQ model made by the member are available for viewing.

The changes at a Model/Scenario level are captured at the History Log.
The comments between the users are displayed at a Node-Scenario level under the 'Comments' icon.

5. Export
----------

Lastly, you can also export all the data values (baseline, comparison, and scenario data) fed and generated at ValQ.
You can export by clicking the 'Export as datasource' option at the additional options dropdown.

Click 'Download CSV' (through Power BI Service) or copy-paste the URLs into Excel (through Power BI Desktop)

In Excel, the copied URLs are fed into the 'From Web' - 'Advanced' window to generate the exported data.

6. Live Syncing export with the ValQ model
---------------------------------------
Users can also run further simulations to their scenarios and instantly synchronize the new data at the export file by refreshing the data query within 'Queries & Connections'.
